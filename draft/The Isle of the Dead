and it was in the following year that Essiahs my lord died.

He was banished to the Isle of the Dead. There where the gods decreed that that mad and the mindless should dwell, until their mortal shells finally released their tortured souls. 
Noone ever returned from the Isle of the Dead. All feared the evil spirits and the souls of the dead which inhabited the Isle of the Dead.

In this time, the cruel Hook had control of the Tribe of the Debh'Ops. His lies and his cowardice were hidden from the Tribe but they sapped the strength and determination from every warrior of the Debh'Ops, until each man stood his watch on the parapets like a wraith, patrolling without sight, so that the borders of the tribe were penetrated time and time again unseen by human eye, and the defenses of the tribe were underminded and weakened. 
The proud warriors fought amongst each other, baffled and confused, unable to trust even their right hand man in the shield wall (in the shield wall, the right side of each man is protected by the shield of the next man - thus it is said that one shall trust ones "Right Hand Man").
Not a man f the tribe knew where the enemy stood, not a man knew where to place his trust, not a man knew where or how he could best be of use to the tribe. the omens were dark, and the dreams of the warriors were filled with doom and blood. 
In this time many warriors felt the need to leave the tribe to pursue their personal quests, and though they left behind a weakened force, they were recognised as heroes.
