## Logging

Each Kuh'undar farmstead, palace or mine had it's own family of Ho'ttep dragons, a "Mother" and her children. 
The mother dragons loved (as all mothers do) to write a daily journal or diary detailing their actions and those of their children. 

Since normal pen and paper, or wax-board and stylus, didn't fit well in dragon claws the mothers usually carved their diaries in the bark of tree trunks. 
These tree trunks, with the daily journals were stored by the Kuh'undar as a record of events, and were called "Logs". 

Logging provided an excellent history of the visitors to each farmstead, but storing the logs often used up many of the resources of the farm, as well as taking a prodigious amount of space. 

The warriors of the Debh'Ops clan were often called to either destroy these Logs, or to conjure Jee'sip demons to transcribe the carved runes onto wax boards so that they could be stored in a more compact form. Each wax board could easily be re-used once the journal was no longer relevant, by melting the wax.

Essiahs travelled to the Land of Oo'Essay and during his travels he met with the shamans of the Apache tribe. Impressed with his knowledge and battle skills, the shamans had shared the secret of the Pipe of Peace. 
Upon his return, Essiahs shared his new knowledge with the warriors of the Debh'Ops tribe and taught each warrior how to make their own pipes and how to use them. 
He conjured Jee'sip demons for each Ho'ttep mother dragon, and trained the mother dragons to smoke the pipe while dictating their journal entries directly to the Jee'sip demons, rather than carving the journals onto tree trunks.
