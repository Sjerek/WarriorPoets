## Lords of the Debh'Ops
### Queen Beddina, The North Woman
After the summer solstice, when Riàrh was sacrificed to the Gods, the Tribe chose a new Leader. The warrior queen Beddina, was chosen as the leader of the tribe. She had a long and proud history as a warrior, and more important, as a Judge.  
Her sword could cut to the quick of an argument, and reveal a truth which all parts could believe.  
Her word was law, and could be weighed in the scales of the Gods without fear. 

Riárh became her humble slave advisor, but despite his stature and disgusting form, she treated the dwarf as a valued counsillor and learnt the Runes and Rituals necessary to slake the thirst of the gods, and to protect the secrets of the tribe.

### The Hook
He had previously been an advisor to a Lord of the Land. A worm, hidden within the armor of a warrior.  
With smoke and mirrors, he managed to hide his inadequacy from the Lords of the tribe.
