## Lords of the Debh'Ops
### Queen Beddina, The North Woman
After the summer solstice, when Riàrh was sacrificed to the Gods, the Tribe chose a new Leader. The warrior queen Beddina, was chosen as the leader of the tribe. She had a long and proud history as a warrior, and more important, as a Judge.  
Her sword could cut to the quick of an argument, and reveal a truth which all parts could believe.  
Her word was law, and could be weighed in the scales of the Gods without fear. 

Riárh became her humble slave advisor, but despite his stature and disgusting form, she treated the dwarf as a valued counsillor and learnt the Runes and Rituals necessary to slake the thirst of the gods, and to protect the secrets of the tribe.

### The Hook
He had previously been an advisor to a Lord of the Land. A worm, hidden within the armor of a warrior.  
With smoke and mirrors, he managed to hide his inadequacy from the Lords of the tribe. With threats, lies and deception he managed to suborn the true aims of the warriors and replace them with shadows and illusions. In the end, he was caught in his own lies, but his legacy was ripe with distrust and dishonour. 
His lies cost the life of Beddina, Queen of th Debh'Ops, and the honour and fellowship of the tribes warriors. 
Whether his mischief was caused by evil, or merely a result of overconfidence and delusions of adequacy remians unknown, although there were signs left in his wake, such as threats and Arh'ceeAyes which point towards his desire to spread distrust and dishonour amongst the proud warriors of the tribe. He had attempted to relax the rules of entry to the tribe to include Spotters - self-proclaimed heroes with unproven battle skills.
