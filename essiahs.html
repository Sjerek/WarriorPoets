<h2>The Rites of Passage, and the Apprenticeship of Essiahs</h2>
<p>
It was a Golden Age.
</p>
<p>The Mighty Warrior-Poets of the Debh'Ops clan worked together with The Estiers and the Kuh'Undar clans and together there was peace, prosperity and harmony in the Land.
</p>
<p>
Essiahs had journeyed to the edge of the Land and trained at The Camp to hone his skills and to learn the Feats of the Warrior Poets and the Words of Power.
