Dear Support Team,   

Upon returning to github after a few years absence .. I appear to be locked out of my account !   
According to the email correspondence above, the account was linked to riar@tdchosting.dk (which is disabled, after leaving that company).   

I can login using my password - but immediately get redirected to "your password is not secure enough", which requires me to send a reset request to ... riar@tdchosting.dk
Since I have successfully logged in, this feels "wrong". Is there anything that can be done ?   

"Sjerek" is a very unique name for me (and quite unique on the internet !), so I really do not want to lose this account on GitHub.   

By updating this MD file, I hope that I have proved that my account is valid. 

RichA. (aka Sjerek)
