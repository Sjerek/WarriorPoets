It was a Golden Age. The Mighty Warrior-Poets of the Debh-Ops clan worked together with The Estiers and the Kuh'Undar clans and together there was peace, prosperity and harmony in the Land. 

Essiahs, a traveller from a far tribe was initiated into the Debh-Ops clan. He had journeyed to the edge of the Land and trained at The Camp to hone his skills, the Feats of the Warrior Poets and the Words of Power.
Essiahs possessed the power of "Forvakling" - when enraged, he was filled with the power of the Earth Goddess, growing to monstrous size, his visage terrible to behold, his will and determination undeniable. 
He learnt to wield the weapons of the Debh-Ops, mastered the Fire Wall and was initiated into the Brotherhood of the Wheel - a sacred bond joining the heroes and true Warrior Poets of all clans. When he left The Camp, he was gifted with the Bash - the magical Pocket Knife. 

Essiahs proved himself as a Warrior Poet to the the tribe of the Debh-Ops. He lead the warriors against the TohmCat Daemons - vicious beasts that could wound and cripple even after death. 
the Kuh'Undar raised the Tohm Cats to help manage the herds and fed them on sheep, but their hunger was ferocious and if they ate too much ram they grew to monstrous size, breaking their bounds and rampaging across the Land. 
 
Essiahs showed the tribe how to tame the Ho'ttep dragons, testing the mother dragon and culling the children, to ensure she could spawn more than the Land could sustain. 
The Ho'ttep dragons were used to protect the many web-farms since they were resistantto the diseases and Giant Worms which otherwise plagued the Kuh'Undar farms, but they needed careful farming to keep their numbers in check. They were vulnerable to the Net Demons and the incessant whispers of the Ha'Kahs, evil sorcerors wearing black hats and controlling terrible powers and magics. Only strong walls and constant attention could protect the Ho'ttep dragons.

He taught the Words of Power that defend against the Kuh'Undar Zombies that threatened to overrun the Land. Though harmless, their memories could confound and confuse, swapping truth for illusion and leading the living into a cycle of thrashing nightmare. 

He studied under the tutelage of Yurken OldSun, high Priest of the Old Gods, Keeper of the faith and wielder of Zephs. Yurken spoke only in riddles, but those who listened to to the truth of his words learned secrets of the Deet'Race and could control the powerful Zephs.

On all his travels and all his adventures, his constant companion was his pet Dwarf, the faithful Ríarh. Essiahs was ever-patient and calm, explaining how to polish, sharpen and wield the weapons of the Debh-Ops, including the magical Bash. Often did Essiahs help Ríarh in his pathic attempts to wield the powerful weapon. Essiahs showed Ríarh the secrets of the Shell, teaching him write only the Truth, and to wield the Words of Power as a true Warrior Poet. 

~~~
The original manuscript contains details of tortures, punishments and reprimands inflicted upon Ríarh by his master Essiahs. Whilst no-one could deny that these were deserved, it is clear that they are pure fabrication and fantasy - no-one could survive the torments that Ríarh describes in such graphic detail. 

The over-exaggeration of Ríarh's description make it obvious to even the casual observer of history that his so-called memoirs are a tissue of lies, no doubt brought on by his despicable drinking habits. 

As a dwarf, Ríarh was capable of consuming unheard of quantities of ale and mead - which he often forgot to remind his master, since it was the single contest he ever managed to win over his master. 
~~~
Indeed, as Mah'Teen the Bear bore witness, Essiahs was always patient, welcoming and helpful ready with advice and encouragement. 

Essiahs was elected as Warrior Chief of the Debh'Ops clan, and lead the Tribe into an era of harmony, peace and prosperity.


The High King and The Cosmic Dragon
===================================

The Sun King Oh'bii, High Ling of the Tribes of the Land, had ruled for seven years os prescribed in the lore and traditions of the tribes. He was a stranger to the tribes, neither Debh'Ops, Estier, Saliyah or Kuh'Undar. He was related to the Sensars and at first the Debh'ops mistrusted his ways and his weapons. 
Only after his glorious victory over the Cosmic Dragon was his position as High King accepted. Instead of the ritual sacrifice at the end of his seven year reign, he was reborn and lead the tribes again as High King and husband of the Earth Goddess for seven more years. 
 In the time the the Great Famine, when the whole world suffered, he discovered that the Saliyah had made treaties with both Kuh'Undar and daemons, promising gold and riches beyond the means of the Land. Oh'Bii gathered gold from the mines of Finan, and persuaded the Arch Druid Jen'Ka to forge a great shield Doh'Labil, made from the bouncing sound of underground spirits. He banished the Saliyah from the Land and saved the Land from the chaos and destruction that ravaged the many worlds. 
Though sorely wounded, the Land recovered, and peace and harmony returned for a while. So did the Saliyah. 

The Saliyah opened a wound into the world and brought forth Rek'sool, the Cosmic Dragon. At first Rek'sool brought wealth and prosperity to the Land, a return to the glories and festivals of bygone days. Rek'sool listened to the songs of the peasant-farmers, spreading wisdom and nurturing the Land. 
The Walker, famous Warror Poet and Rune-Smith learned to feed Rek'sool and quench it's thirst for blood, bone and song. Together with his brother-in-arms S'aybe'Hook they formed a team of ingenious Smiths, who had crafted tools and devices to help the Kuh'Undar reap their harvests and sow the fields since time immemorial. They delved deep into the secrets and mysteries of the Scarlet Hoods and the Slezz, learning secret paths to Eyeoh and the return of Maisi-Kwell. 
 The Cosmic Dragon, feeding upon images of pain and stories of injury and death, proved too strong for the chains forged by the Saliyah, and became glutted. He swallowed, gorged and feasted without end, but hid his secrets deep in the darkness. The Walker bravely faced the beast, but was saved by the magical powers of Oh'Bii. The High King had pretended to sleep, but in truth had meditated and entered the Astral Plane, forging the great Skwel - the Magic Spear - sharpened with the power of Siip'less. Oh'Bii battled the Cosmic Dragon for twenty days and twenty nights and finally disembowweled the beast, proving that it had eaten more than it could chew. 
 The Walker and his brother were suborned and enslaved by the Saliyah. But The Walker was wounded deeply in the war against the Cosmic Dragon and all knew that his days in the Land were numbered. Driven far from the lands of the Debh-Ops, they were enslaved to the Pleaders and coerced into delivering powerful weapons and tools into the hands of the Kuh'Undar. 
 The Kuh'Undar were farmers and merchants, skilled in their craft but unwise in the battle skills of the Debh-Ops. They rejoiced in their new-found power, unaware that the tools were twin-edged. They were not trained to temper their powers with restraint and patience and lacked the battle skills and inner harmony of the Debh-Ops Warrior Poets. They could not see the danger of releasing the War Machines and Weapons, how destructive they were in the grasp of the uninitiated. 
  Where once there had been peace and harmony in balance with nature, now beasts and daemons rampaged across the land, devouring crops and herds, raising alarms amongst the Watchers of Nagio. Where once the Land shone green in the sunlight, now was the constant bright red glow of flame, blood and death. The Watchers of the Nagio and the servants of the Estiers despaired, powerless to quell the flames which sprang up in every corner and smouldered in every shadow. 

The Great Rebellion and the Defeat of Essiahs
=============================================

Enraged by the perfidy of the Saliyah, Essiahs lead the Warrior Poets of of the Debh-ops clan into rebellion. He faced the chiefs of the other tribes and demanded the right of single combat. he chanted the Words of Power and war-poems and the wisdom learnt from Yurken Old Sun. He realised that his enemies were unimpressed with these ancient truths, so he drew upon the power of the Earth Goddess to transform himself into a monstrous creation of pure rage and terror. 
But the chiefs belonged to the Tribe, and the Tribe claimed protection from the High King, Oh'Bii. Oh'Bii stood strong, protected by Doh'Labil the shield of Undeground Spirits. When the rage and power drained away, Oh'Bii and the Saliyah stood unharmed, while the friends and clansmen of the Debh-Ops were sorely wounded.
To protect his clan and friends, Essiahs accepted the tortures and torments demanded by the other clan chiefs, relinquinshing his title and position as Warrior Chief of the Debh-Ops. 
  He named his pet dwarf Ríarh as his surrogate, to rule in his stead. Essiahs retreated to a role of councillor and mentor. He dedicated himself to the cult of Ankor Manj and became a Puppet Master, teaching the warriors of the Debh-Ops clan to understand the Ohgam ("o111o1o11oooo111o1o"), the language of the War Machines and to translate the screams of the Net Demons. 

Eyesogh and the Fall of the Tribe
=================================

  With his defeat of the Cosmic Dragon, Oh'Bii had proved himself an honorary member of the Debh-Ops clan. Alas, even his cunning could not overrule the traditions of the Land. After his seven year reign, he was sacrificied to the Earth Goddess as prescribed in the Lore of the Land and a new High King was chosen. 
  JayBol was a distant cousin of the Saliyah clan and was powerless to resist the wiles and sorceries of OneField, the High Priestess of the Saliyah. He invited a race of golbins, the Hinjans, into the tribe and slowly they began to overtake the traditional duties and rituals of the Debh-Ops clan. The Goblin King Tata promised that his goblin warriors were a match for the Warrior Poets of the Debh-Ops clan, but in truth their weapons were puny and they lacked the Battle Skills, wisdom and understanding derived from the years of training necessary to become a member of the Debh-Ops. 
  The goblins of Hinjah gained access to the Words of Power, but lacked the spark of Creativity which had allowed the Warrior Poets to craft tools and rist runes and compose sagas and poetry. 

  OneField, High Priestess of the Saliyah, deceived the Kuh'Undar into worshipping a fale god, Eyesogh. The Kuh'Undar belived that Eyesogh would bring Stability and Security to the Land, an era of peace and harmony. In truth, Eyesogh was empty. Deception without Spirit or Soul, meaningless chants, rituals and scripture with only one purpose - to fill the coffers of the Saliyah. 
  the once glorious warriors of the Debh-Ops were enslaved, chained by the rituals of Eyesogh while the Land stagnated. Instead of declaiming poetry and battling monsters, creating wondrous machines and wielding ingenious tools, the Debh-Ops were reduced to toil as beasts of labour, struggling to till and irrigate the fields of the Kuh'Undar. Cruel overseers, known as the Ensi'Pah, forced the Debh-Ops to follow the Chant Rituals of Eyesogh. The Debh-Ops were blinkered, blindfolded, and the ancient ways of the Land were changed without real consideration of the risks and dangers. 

  Essiahs had ruled as Warrior-Chief of the Debh-Ops for the allotted seven years - even though he had given the mantle and title to his per Dwarf, Ríarh, he was still honored as chief. He decided that the time had come to for the ritual sacrifice of the Chief, spilling the noble blood as an offering to the Earth Goddess, so that she might regain her strength. Freed from the worries and tribulations of the Land, he would rise up into the Cloud Lands, seeking peace, purity and harmony. 

  The Debh-Ops tribe mourned his passing, and raised up a great Cairn, placing his body within. His armor and weapons, scrolls and tools, even the mighty Bash were placed reverently inside and the tomb was sealed with Runes and sigils. Ríarh, filled with grief (and possibly having drunk too much mead at the funeral), prophesied that Essiahs would return to the Land at the time of their greatest need, bringing with him knowledge of the True Cloud, and chanting new Songs of Power. 

The End. 

(at least, for now. Hic !)
 
Glossary
========

The Tribe: the inhabitants of the land, an alliance of the clans - Kuh'Undar, Slemmes, Estiers, Saliyah, Pleaders and Debh-Ops working together for the glory of the Earth Goddess, lead by her mortal husband the High King.  

The Pleaders: Once talented architects and builders, helping create wondrous art and works of beauty, they degenerated into a mindless slave-clan, totally subordinate to the Saliyah. One amongst the Pleaders fought long against the demands of the Saliyah, Rikah the Yellow, but she was wounded while travelling in foreign lands and at last was expelled from the Land. Brutal overlords enforing the will of the Saliyah, they bend and twist the desires of the Kuh'Undar, listening to the words and unable to hear the Spirit Within deafened by the whispers of the Saliyah. 

The Saliyah: cunning and clever, ever-mindful of their own gain and the rules and rituals of their God, "Doh'Labil". Some among the Saliyah, such as Mass Wheel, tried to translate the needs of the Kuh'undar and share the warnings given by the Debh-Ops, but after OneField became High Priestess and Chieftain of the clan, such resistance to the tenets of their Doh'Labil faith has become impossible. 

The Druids of Finan: Lead by Jen'Kah the Arch-Druid. Perceived by many as the heart and soul of the tribes, keepers of the Pulse. In truth, the druids no longer listened to the will of the Earth Goddess, and became deaf and blind to the agonies of the tribes. They could not hear the sounds of pain and torment of the Kuh'Undar or the Debh-Ops, seeing only the glitter of coin and treasure brought in by the Kuh'undar at the demand of the Saliyah. 

The Watchers of Nagio: Holy priests, serving the many temples of Nagio throughout the land, ensuring the Bale-Fires are always ready to spread warning in case of danger. Without their help, the mighty Warrior-Poets of the Debh-Ops would be blind and helpless. Revered and respected by the Debh-Ops, they struggle to comply with the needs of the Slemmes and translate the unfathomable texts of the Saliyah. 

The Brotherhood of the Beehk: an extinct family of messengers, capable of running long distances without rest or sustenance. They were defeated in an epic struggle during the invasion of Koby Too, replaced by the Watcher of Nagio. 

The Slemmes: Spokesmen for the Kuh'Undar. The Slemmes can translate the sacred treaties written in the secret language of the Saliyah and understand the brutish grunts and gestures of the Kuh'Undar. At first, the Slemmes helped the warlike Debh-Ops communicate with the peaceful Kuh'Undar. However, in the years leading up to the fall of the Land they became secretive and introspective, demanding that the Watchers of Nagio translate the sacred texts and that the Debh-Ops spoke directly to the Kuh'Undar. No-one knows what the Slemmes researched in this time, but no-one doubts that it took all their energies and prevented the Slemmes from aiding the other clans in any way at all.

The Kuh'Undar: the peasant farmers and merchants, upon whom the fate of the land rests. It is the Kuh'Undar who reap the harvest and pay the taxes which keep the Land alive. They rely on the other clans to protect their farms and businesses. 

The Estiers: faithful and ever-watchful, the Estiers are a noble race. Unlike any of the other clans, they are patient, caring and humble. The Estiers strive to learn the secrets of all the clans, not for their own benefit, but rather that they can help the Kuh'Undar or the Debh-Ops or the Slemmes in time of need. A few dedicated members of the Estiers clan have been initiated into other clans, as token of esteem for their hard work and dedication. Sohn, son of Jehn and Efbi'Hoh are some of the few who proved themselves and became members of the Debh-Ops clan. 

The Debh-Ops: Warrior-Poets, always ready to ride into battle against daemons, zombies or dragons. Armored with the Shell and chanting the Words of Power, they wield weapons more like surgeons than berserkers. They are ready to carve, cut, burn and kill, ready to dive deep into blood and guts - but only as much as necessary to remove disease and repair the wound. They compete against each other to compose the most eloquent of poems, craft the sharpest weapons and design the most powerful tools. Whilst they possess the spirit of Creativity, they often struggle to communicate - both with strangers and sometimes even with members of their own clan or tribe. [translation note: in celtic "ebh" is pronounced "ayve"]

Ogham: an ancient and very basic language, based on simple scratches of either lines or circles - o111oo1o11o111o11. The language of the Earth Goddess and the War Machines. 

Heks: The language of the Net Daemons. Also known as Ohk'dal, this was based on Ogham.

Doh'Labil: Great Shield of Oh'Bii. Also known as "Reflected Sound of Underground Spirits". Forged from the bones of the Old Gods merged with metals from the mines of Finan, it was decorated with sigils and runes written in the Elder Tongue. Doh'Labil is also the name of the god / demon / spirit worshipped by the Saliyah clan.

The Bash: also called "The Pocket Knife", this wondrous weapon was capable of transforming into any shape the wielder desired, blunt and heavy, long and pointy or curved and sharp. Immensely powerful, it was also incredibly dangerous if ever held in the wrong hands. 

Ho'ttep Dragon: A domesticated form for dragon, capable of protecting the homes and farms of the Kuh'Undar. Breeding and training Ho'ttep dragons was a major part of the day to day work of the Debh'Ops. 

Vee'Kay Dragon: a mutated breed of the Ho'ttep dragon often found on the wild. They were impossible to domesticate, and often capable of spawning vast numbers of children which could lay waste to vast tracts of land. 

Har'Li Dragon: a legendary breed of dragon, usually found in the land of the Oo'essay. They were large enough for two full grown warriors to ride upon their bacs, and famous for their smooth and comfortable ride.  

Tohm Cat: used by Kuh'Undar herders to control the flocks. When fully domesticated they were capable of managing large herds of different beasts, their saber-teeth and sharp claws sufficient to enforce order and control upon the most obstinate herd. They were especially suited to helping the Kuh'Undar manage Jay'vehms, a breed of long-horned cattle favored for their milk and flesh. Tohm Cats preferred to eat sheep, but if fed too much Ram, they could easily become unruly and uncontrollable. 

Dii Bees: a giant breed of Bees, which could gather honey from many different sources. The Dii Bee hives were enormous structures, usually perfectly symmetrical and filled with a highly ordered society of mindless drones performing the work of the Hive; continuously gathering, building, structuring and refining the collected pollen. Occasionally a Dii beehive would go amok, usually due to lack of living space in the Hive or if groups of worker drones suddenly became obsessed with a particular task, blocking entry and disturbing the harmony of the entire Hive. Beehives were highly prized, and very susceptible to lice and infection, so they were often hidden behind multiple layers of defense including Walls of Fire, Tohm Cats and Ho'ttep Dragons.

Web Farms: a popular method of farming amongst the Kuh'undar utilising giant spiders to create silken webs to catch birds and giant insects - highly prized in the markets of the Kuh'undar. Since the webs were particularly vulnerable to worms and viruses, they were often protected by Ho'ttep Dragons. 

Esh'esh'Ho portals: The Monks of the Secret and Holy Order of the Net maintained an ancient system of ley-lines (lines of power flowing through the land) connecting the major cities of the land with the outlying farms, hold-fasts, Watch-Towers of the Nagio and the castles of the Kuh'Undar. The Portals of Esh'esh'ho in the three central cities ( Stonehenge, Tile Home and The House of Paddles ) allowed the Warriors of the Debh'Ops to travel instantly wherever they were needed to battle against threats to the harmony of the Land.

Walls of Fire: Two major vulcanoes in the land - Tjek'Poyn and Si'iskoh - provided the Monks of the Secret and Holy Order of the Net with the means to create trenches and barriers filled with Molten Lava, impossible to cross except by specially constructed bridges. Unfortunately the demands of the Kuh'Undar for the right to travel also allowed "unwanted guests" to sneak across the bridges hidden in the travelling caravans of the Kuh'Undar, bypassing the Walls of Fire. 

Bii'Pee: the accumulated knowledge and tradition of the Debh'Ops clan. The sacred Bii'pee texts and writings form the basis for training new Debh'Ops as well as defining the initiation ceremonies knows as Oayties and the rules and traditions of the Pur'Pet.
